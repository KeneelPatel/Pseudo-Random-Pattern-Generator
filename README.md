# Pseudo Random Pattern Generator
This project, takes a user selected number as an input and generates 16 byte pseudo random pattern. This project uses middle square method to generate the each random new seed. This project uses different logic operations to calculate the hamming weight and the hamming distance between each number and calculates the average at the end.
